recommendation model by association analysis



Insted of rating value, I found original rule between users and items, so I used category ids as a substitute for rating. 

Its way to find original rule is using transaction history for association analysis and I made meta label by category id.

Finally, I made recommendation model which recommend users bought similar type items. Mainly, the model consists of NN and Ranknet.


The details, process and logic are wrritten below my blog.
