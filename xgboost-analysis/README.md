# xgboost-feature-analysis
analysis of two segments fetures by xgboost and multiple regression analysis.


One segment depends on users bought only once(users 1) and the other depends on users bought more than once (users 2).


I did this project as follows ;


1st. feture engineering.

2nd. Analyze by xgboost(including dart and hyperopt) and multiple regression analysis.

The details and process are written below my blog.
